# 🎨 Dribbble Clone — HTML & CSS Learning Milestone

> A responsive **Dribbble homepage clone** built using **pure HTML and CSS**, created at the end of my first learning phase in front-end development.
> This project represents my 20-day journey of understanding web structure, layout systems, and visual styling.

## 🧩 Overview

This was my **finishing project** for HTML & CSS — a personal challenge to recreate the Dribbble homepage using only front-end fundamentals.
I focused on structure, alignment, spacing, and making it visually close to the real design.

I intentionally didn’t include dropdowns or interactivity because I wanted to move forward to learning **JavaScript**, and not spend too much time trying to force complex behaviors with only CSS.

## ✨ Features

* Clean and minimal homepage layout
* Smooth transitions and hover effects
* Responsive design up to **max-width: 480px** (mobile view)
* Organized navigation bar, hero section, and gallery grid
* Custom icons, typography, and layered gradients

---

## ✅ Pros (What Went Well)

* Well-structured HTML with readable class names
* Strong understanding of **Flexbox** and **Grid** fundamentals
* Consistent spacing, alignment, and overall layout quality
* CSS transitions and animations that add visual depth
* Fully responsive down to the **480px breakpoint**

---

## ⚠️ Cons (What Could Be Better)

* I couldn’t fully understand some advanced flex properties (like `flex: 1 1 0`),
  so parts of the layout aren’t perfectly responsive at all widths.
* Dropdowns and interactivity weren’t implemented — by choice —
  since I wanted to move ahead and learn **JavaScript** for that.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

* How to structure and style a realistic landing page using HTML & CSS only
* The difference between using **Flexbox** vs **Grid** effectively
* Managing fonts, icons, and assets professionally
* Writing cleaner, reusable CSS classes
* Understanding breakpoints and mobile-first thinking
